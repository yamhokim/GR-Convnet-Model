Training log for Map-based GRConvNet4

Classification: 
- v1 - Map-based GRConvNet4, DoubleLogLoss (FAILS)
    - LR = 5e-4
    - batch size = 16

- v2 - Map-based GRConvNet4, DoubleLogLoss (FAILS)
    - LR = 1e-6
    - batch size = 16
    - DoubleLogLoss was scaled by the inverse of training samples in each
      class to account for class imbalance. Model still fails to train.
    - Checkerboard artifacts in output maps, suggesting upsampling would be 
      better than transposed convolution.

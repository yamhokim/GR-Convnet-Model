Initial attempts with a feature based resnet predictor for classification on the jacquard dataset.
This was done since the map based predictor was not working despite several attempts, so I decided to
go back to simple classification with a pretrained model to identify where the problem arises.

Feature based => model outputs are numeric logits, not map-based

- v1 - ResNet50 Jacquard CLS, No depth map, CrossEntropyLoss
    - Success, model achieves ~75% accuracy in under 20 epochs
    - Batch size 32
    - Learning rate 1e-4

- v2 - ResNet50 Jacquard CLS, With depth map, CrossEntropyLoss
    - Success, model achieves ~72% accuracy in under 20 epochs
    - Batch size 32
    - Learning rate 1e-4

- v3 - ResNet50 Jacquard CLS, With depth map, DoubleLogLoss         <--- first failure (occurs with introduction of DoubleLogLoss)
    - Model fails to learn
    - Average loss consistently reduces
    - accuracy stuck at 0.396396
    - Batch size 32
    - Learning rate 1e-4
